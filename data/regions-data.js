To further             improve upon this score, Somalia can work through efforts like the Djibouti Code of Conduct to boost regional maritime situational awareness.. Further progress can be made by improving inter-agency cooperation between regional coast  guards and port police departments.. Through these efforts, Somalia can raise its weakest score and work toward comprehensive and lasting maritime security."

Djibouti's score of 74 in this area is high relative to its other issue scores,          due in part to the sharp decline of piracy in the Gulf of Aden and the western Indian Ocean.. Djibouti can further improve upon this area of relative strength by working with neighbors to fight piracy in potential hot spots and safeguard against maritime piracy and terrorism in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden."

To further             improve upon this score, Djibouti can invest in anti-corruption efforts and increase judicial accountability.. Further progress can be made by eliminating bureaucratic red tape that inhibits smooth international trade and enables bribe-seeking. The World Bank Doing Business Report finds trade is significantly more difficult in Djibouti than it is elsewhere in the region.. Through these efforts, Djibouti can raise its weakest score and work toward comprehensive and lasting maritime security."
